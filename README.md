# Write a Data Science blog post - CFPB Text Analysis

## Data

This project utilizes the CFPB complaints data. The data is downloaded from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consumer Complaint Database, which, "is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response".

## Project Roadmap

This project is part of the "Write A Data Science Blog Post" of the Udacity Data Scientist nano degrees program. In this project, I will be exploring three things around consumer complaints:
1) The financial products consumers complaint about most frequently
2) The vocabulary of the complaint narrative and how it evolved over time
3) What particular types of narrative determine a timely response from the company
